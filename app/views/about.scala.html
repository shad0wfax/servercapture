			        <ol>
					  <li>Customer service is mostly about managing the expectations and experiences of consumers. However, most technological advancements in this domain (e.g., Salesforce ServiceCloud) have largely focused on the efficiency of customer service agents, and not consumers.</li>
					  <li>Using rich media in customer support interactions always leads to a quicker resolution. Despite >50% Americans owning smart handhelds capable of instant rich-media interactions, most customer service activities still happen on email, web form or telephone.</li>
					</ol>

		            <h4>Vision</h4>
		          </div>
		          <p>We are re-thinking the areas of customer service and technical support in CRM systems. Our service will enable interaction between support teams of businesses and their customers in high-resolution. We are creating cloud infrastructure, smartphone apps, browser tools and services that enable rich-media communication end-to-end.</p>
		          <p>We envision:</p>
		          <p>
			        <ol>
					  <li>Square : Payments :: Visual Rendezvous : Customer engagement - Just like how Square modernized payment kiosks enabling any-size business to accept payments, we enable any-size business to offer a personalized customer engagement experience without new infrastructure.</li>
					  <li>The customer tools we provide will become de facto means to reach out to any business. We will try to programmatically proxy the request to a business that is not registered with us.</li>
					  <li>Providing data analytics, identifying trends on support issues, and provide automation.</li>
					</ol>
		        </section>
		
		        <section id="our-product">
		          <div class="page-header">
		            <h4>Product</h4>
		          </div>
		          <p>We are building technologies/services that enable high-resolution interaction between businesses and their customers. We provide smart device apps, browser tools and cloud services that empower users to capture, edit, store, share and search rich media in the context of customer support activities.</p>
		          <p>Our tools and services will enable consumers and businesses to interact with each other using a device of their choice, at a time that fits their schedule and in a format that works best for the cause – and not be bound by the technical or operational limitations of the other side.</p>
		          <p>We are driven by two visions (one on business side and another on consumer side).</p>
		          <p>
			        <ol>
					  <li>Enable all businesses to offer a personalized customer engagement experience like Apple without having to invest in new manpower or compute infrastructure. This is similar to how Square modernized payments for small/medium businesses.</li>
					  <li>Provide consumers with a single unified interface that they can use to reach out to any business. For those businesses that have not signed up with us, we will have automated ways to proxy the consumer requests.</li>
					</ol>

				   <dt>Asynchronous</dt>
				   <dd>Using our mobile app or browser tools, consumers can capture short videos that describe their problem, annotate/transcode/highlight/blackout portions of this video, search for the business, and send it across to them – all from within the same app. It also takes care of product identification, response tracking, and content management on the cloud.</dd>
  				 </dl>
				 <dl>	
				   <dt>Synchronous</dt>
				   <dd>Consumers can also request for a live session with business. Users can specify their preferred times and mode of interaction (regular phone, Apple FaceTime, Google Hangout, Skype). Our apps take care of this signaling, negotiating session parameters, setting up reminders and firing up external apps on time.</dd>

		          </div>
		          <p>We are excited about technology and love to build stuff with the latest gear. A few things that pique our interest are: </p>
		          <dl>
				   <dt><span class="label label-success">WebRTC</span></dt>
				   <dd>Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) enable browser to browser applications for voice calling, video chat and P2P file sharing without plugins.</dd>
				   <dd>Our "Photo" feature is already harnessing this. We are developing Video, ScreenSharing and other technologies based on this.</dd>
  				 </dl>
		          <dl>
				   <dt><span class="label label-success">Computer Vision</span></dt>
				   <dd>Computer Vision (CV) helps to recognize objects, interpret scenes and detect intents. A lot of what we help collect are visual artifacts - Photos and Videos.</dd>
				   <dd>We hope to leverage CV to analyze common themes across visual feedback sent. The goal is to help companies understand their customer problems better and automate support.</dd>
  				 </dl>
		          <dl>
				   <dt><span class="label label-success">Big Data</span></dt>
				   <dd>Most companies spend very little time analyzing historical issues. Usually the effort needed to do so is enormous, unless they have efficient systems in place.</dd>
				   <dd>With our product companies collect all their issues and feedback in one place. We aim to apply some of the data analysis techniques to spot trends and provide automated responses for new issues.</dd>
